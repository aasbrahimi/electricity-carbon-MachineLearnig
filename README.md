# Electricity Carbon Mix Prediction

# Project Overview
This project aims to build machine learning models capable of predicting the carbon quality of the electricity generation mix in France, using weather and calendar variables.

# Objective
Predict the variable `MixProdElec` (multiclass classification):
- **Carbonised**
- **Normal**
- **Decarbonised**

# Machine Learning Approach
Several supervised classification models were implemented and compared:
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Decision Tree

Models were evaluated using the **Average Classification Accuracy** metric.

# Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` : notebook experiments
- `report/` : final report (PDF)
- `data/` : dataset information (not included)
- `statement/` : Kaggle statement summary
